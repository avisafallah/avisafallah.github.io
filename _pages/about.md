## Who am I?


Hey there! I'm Avisa Fallah, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the College of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, University of Tehran. From a young age, my interests have spanned a wide spectrum, from a deep passion for the arts, particularly painting, to the sheer delight of solving complex mathematical problems. However, as my love for art, mathematics, and a newfound passion for programming grew, I found my true calling in Computer Science. Since then, I've immersed myself in the exciting worlds of mathematics and programming. Along this journey, I delved into the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence, completing courses in AI and image processing, which sparked my curiosity about the role of brain function in decision-making, emotions, and thoughts.

Today, I am thrilled to be an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Tehran, where I focus on integrating AI into the fields of neuroscience and art. I am all about chasing dreams and believe that we discover our true selves when we push past our fears and doubts. I am a passionate and ever-curious individual who thrives on embracing diverse interests and learning from the incredible journey of life.


## Research Interests


My research interests primarily revolve around neuroscience and its applications in predicting, detecting, and treating mental health diseases and disorders. Specifically, I am fascinated by the intricacies of brain function, particularly their role in decision-making processes and human emotions and behaviors.

Furthermore, I am deeply passionate about the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with the realm of art, thanks to my background in art. This encompasses the creation of intelligent paintings and music compositions, as well as an analysis of AI's potential to emulate the human creativity in generating brilliant art pieces.

## Other Interests


Beyond my academic pursuits, I have always been drawn to various forms of artistic expression. From a young age, I immersed myself in the world of art, exploring activities such as painting, singing, playing musical instruments, acting in theater productions, and the joy of reading poems and novels. I began my artistic journey as a painter at the tender age of three, inspired by the magical world around me. Moreover, I maintain a healthy lifestyle through activities like swimming and playing volleyball, and I strive to assist others in various ways whenever I can. These endeavors provide me with a profound sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Life's a canvas, and I'm painting it with these passions.
