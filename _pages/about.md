Who am I?
======
Hey there! I'm Avisa Fallah, a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Tehran's College of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, based in the vibrant city of Tehran, Iran.

From a young age, my interests have spanned a wide spectrum, from a deep passion for the arts, particularly painting, to the sheer delight of solving complex mathematical problems. During my high school years,  I got curious about chemistry, led me to enroll in the Materials and Metallurgy program at the University of Tehran. But guess what? I discovered a passion for programming during a coding class.

However, as my love for mathematics and programming grew, my interest in chemistry began to wane, resulting to switch my major to Computer Science in my fourth semester. It was a big move, but totally worth it, as I finally found my true calling. As the saying goes, it's never too late to chase your dreams. 

Since then, I've been diving deep into the exciting world of mathematics and programming. Along this journey, I have delved into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, having completed courses in AI and image processing.

Today, I'm thrilled to be an undergrad research assistant at the University of Tehran, where I focus on bringing AI into the realms of neuroscience and art.

I'm all about chasing dreams and believe that we find our true selves when we push past our fears and doubts. I'm a passionate, and ever-curious individual who thrives on embracing diverse interests and learning from the incredible journey of life.


Research Interests
======

My research interests primarily revolve around neuroscience and its applications in predicting, detecting, and treating mental health diseases and disorders. Specifically, I am fascinated by the intricacies of brain function, particularly their role in decision-making processes and human emotions and behaviors.

Furthermore, I am deeply passionate about the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with the realm of art, thanks to my background in art. This encompasses the creation of intelligent paintings and music compositions, as well as an analysis of AI's potential to emulate the human creativity in generating brilliant art pieces.


Other Interests
======

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have always been drawn to various forms of artistic expression. From a young age, I immersed myself in the world of art, exploring activities such as painting, singing, playing musical instruments, acting in theater productions, photography, and the joy of writing and reading poems and novels. 

I began my artistic journey as a painter at the tender age of three, inspired by the magical world around me. Over the years, I've not only honed my skills in painting but also gained valuable experiences in each of the activities I mentioned.

In addition, I boost my brainpower and maintain a healthy lifestyle through activities like swimming and playing volleyball. 

Finally, a source of immense satisfaction in my life is the opportunity to help others in various ways whenever I can. This altruistic endeavor provides me with a profound sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Life's a canvas, and I'm painting it with these passions.
