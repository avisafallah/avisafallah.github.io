## Who am I?


Hey there, I’m Avisa Fallah!
I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from the University of Tehran’s College of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. My journey has been shaped by a love for both the arts and sciences, from painting and creative expression to solving complex mathematical problems. You can visit my art portfolio [here](https://www.artstation.com/lenavi). Through these passions, I found my true calling in neuroscience, where cognition, art, mathematics, and programming converge.

My curiosity led me to the world of computational neurocognition, which deepened my interest in how brain function influences our thoughts and behavior. To strengthen my theoretical and practical foundation, I completed several computational courses in brain-related fields, including machine learning, neuroimaging, large language models, and natural language processing.

Now, as a research assistant, I focus on integrating computational and analytical skills with neuroscience, cognitive science, and art to move forward in the realm of brain sciences. I believe that pursuing dreams and stepping beyond fear are key to growth. Passionate and ever-curious, I thrive on learning from life’s endless possibilities.

## Research Interests


My research focuses on applying image processing and machine learning skills in neuroscience and cognitive science to explore brain mechanisms, predict, detect, and treat brain disorders, as well as support cognitive rehabilitation. I’m especially fascinated by the complexities of brain function, including its role in vision, perception, emotion, decision-making, learning, and social cognition. Additionally, driven by my enthusiasm for art, I'm passionate about how artistic elements can be used in therapy to address neurocognitive impairments.

I’m especially fascinated by the complexities of brain function, including its role in memory, perception, decision-making, attention, learning, aesthetic preferences, emotions, sleep, metacognition, moral reasoning, and social cognition. Additionally, driven by my enthusiasm for art, I'm passionate about how artistic elements, such as music and painting, can enhance cognition and help address cognitive disabilities. I’m also fascinated by AI’s ability to emulate human creativity and its potential to generate original artwork. -->


## Other Interests


Beyond academia, I’ve always been captivated by various forms of artistic expression. From painting, calligraphy, and photography to singing, playing musical instruments, and performing in theater, art has been an essential part of my life. I began painting at the age of three, inspired by the world around me. I also enjoy reading poetry and novels, as well as watching movies and series. Maintaining a balanced life is also essential to me, which is why I stay active through swimming and volleyball while also striving to help others whenever possible. These pursuits give me a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Life's a canvas, and I'm painting it with all my passions.
